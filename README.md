# Bike Share Analysis Case Study

This project is part of the Capstone for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. The goal was to explore bike-sharing data to uncover trends and provide insights for business decision-making.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on data cleaning, exploration, and visualization of bike-share usage patterns. The report outlines:

- Differences in ridership between **casual users** and **annual members**
- Trip duration, time-of-day trends, and weekday/weekend usage
- Recommendations for improving customer engagement

##  Tools Used

- **R** and **RStudio**
- `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2`
- R Markdown for reporting

##  Key Findings

- Members tend to take shorter, more frequent trips.
- Casual users are more active on weekends.
- Seasonal patterns affect ridership significantly.

##  Files Included

- `Bike_Share_Case_Study.pdf` – Final report (fully formatted and ready for review)
- `Bike_Share_Case_Study.Rmd` – Source R Markdown file (for reproducibility)
